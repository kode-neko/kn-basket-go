## 🗒️ 1. Description

There was a contest where each participant or team must create an app for disability people 🦽 So I decided to present an shop interface for blind ones 🦮 The color palette is high contrast and I wanted to include some sound or voice system 🎨🗣️🔊 However, these interesting features got out of teh scope ☹️

Welcome to anyone who want to improve this project 👍 I have never worked in collabs projects, but we can stablish some rules 📐 If you are interested contact me, introduce the changes in a new branch and finally we decide to included or not. On the other hand, if you make a fork for personal porpouses, contact me to show the link of that project 😀
